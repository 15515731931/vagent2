In addition to direct contributions, there are indirect contributions. PHK
(Poul-Henning Kamp) deserves thanks for writing Varnish Cache, but in this
particular project, more for being a teacher to myself and others.

Martin Blix Grydeland wrote the original agent, and provided valuable
advise during the development of the second varnish agent.
